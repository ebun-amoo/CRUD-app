# CRUD-app
## This app is called Writing tracker. 
To run the app locally, you can clone the GitHub repository (https://github.com/kibo-web-app-dev-jan-23/final-project---crud-app-meta-verse-1) and download all the dependencies in the requirement.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt

The app is deployed on: https://writing-tracker2.onrender.com/

What our app does: Every author or student needs to keep track of whatever it is they are working on, and they also need to be time conscious of their writing. The writing tracker enables you to add the title of your write-up and the due date. The app provides every user with a library that contains their writeups and how many days they have left to the deadline. The user is also able to update, edit and delete this information.
